# Morphology-analysis
Extract morphological characteristics from trait segmented fish

The goals of the tool is to extract measurments and landmarks of fish from the segmented fish iamge porduce by [Maruf code]().
It provides a framework with various tools such as class and notebook to help further development.
Another goal is to release working version to in container for easy integration into workflow such as [BGNN_Snakemake]
This tool is a part of a bigger project, find the overview [here]
